\hypertarget{writing-standards}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Writing Standards}

For this course, you are expected to follow the writing standards according to APA 7. Please consult the \href{https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html}{OWL Purdue website} for guidance and seek assistance from the TWU Writing Center and writing coaches as needed. Assignments have rubrics that attribute some marks to APA formatting and cannot be graded as fully meeting expectations if there are APA errors. That said, your conceptual understanding remains of primary importance. It is your responsibility to ensure polished work to the highest standard of which you are capable. This demands meticulous attention to detail, which will become more `natural' with practice. Please seek any necessary clarification from your instructor.

\begin{caution}
\textbf{\emph{It will be assumed that you have read, understand, and
agree to the information provided at the
\href{https://www.twu.ca/student-handbook/university-policies/academic-misconduct/procedures-dealing-acts-academic-0}{Academic

\hypertarget{course-communities}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Course Communities}

As you begin this course, how will you build community with your fellow learners?

In this course, we have the following tools available to help foster community in your course, including other students who have previously taken this course. Some of these tools will be prescribed and graded (e.g.~Moodle Discussion Forums), others will be up to you to take advantage of.

Check with your course syllabus for which community tools will be used, and consider building your own Community of Practice with your classmates and external colleagues.

\hypertarget{communication-tools}{%
\section*{Communication Tools}\label{communication-tools}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Communication Tools}

\textbf{Moodle Discussion Forums}: In this course, we ask you to discuss ideas with your colleagues, challenging one another and analyzing key course resources. Refer to the course syllabus for assessment details, as well as the unit Assessment section for discussion questions. Submit your responses in Moodle.

\textbf{Video Conferencing}: We will have scheduled online meetings (Zoom or Teams). Take advantage of these face-to-face conferences! Come prepared with your questions and assigned activities. Refer to the course syllabus and unit activity instructions for details.

\emph{Optional:}

Your cohort may want to engage in other informal discussions to build community and support each other. Consider using the following:

\textbf{Learning Cafe:} This discussion forum in Moodle is a place for you to interact about things going on, share resources, and generally get to know one another. Your posts don't have to be course related. Take this opportunity to connect with fellow learners and learn from one another!

\textbf{Teams:} Every TWU course has a Teams channel, mostly to manage videos. Feel free to use the messaging feature to connect with peers.

\textbf{Twitter hashtag \texttt{\#CRSE\#\#\#}:} You can tweet about this course using \texttt{\#CRSE\#\#\#}.

\textbf{What's App:} Feel free to use a platform that works for you!! What's App is a popular chat forum that learners use for discussions, class projects, etc.

A key takeaway\ldots make these forums work for you! Interact with your peers, learn from each other, and make connections that will stay with you beyond this course.

With that, let's begin the journey together!

\begin{assessment}
Investigate the Human Resources or Faculty Development portion of a
company's website, a higher education institution or adult learning
facility, preferably one with which you are familiar. Focus on the
faculty or employee development part of the website. In this assignment,
you will apply the theory of teaching in/for/with depth by analyzing the
learning culture of an organization.

In a 4-5 page APA formatted paper, analyze the website by responding to
the following questions in your report:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What can you infer about the company's learning culture?
\item
  From what is visible on the public website, would you say it is an
  authentic learning community? Why or why not? Discuss whether the
  website reflects aspects of one or more of the learning community
  models explored in previous lessons.
\item
  Do you see evidence that interconnectedness and integrity are valued?
  Explain.
\item
  What traits and skills seem to be valued in employees?
\item
  How does the company develop skills in its employees (e.g., workshops,
  seminars, mentoring)? Are the methods based on the principles of
  andragogy? (see Smith YouTube video). What specific adult learning
  strategies do you see reflected in the development/training
  opportunities for employees?
\end{enumerate}

Your paper should be 4-5 pages and should incorporate references to at
least five scholarly sources you have studied in this course, or other
scholarly sources you have identified.

The paper should include:

\begin{assessment}
For this assignment, you will write a contextualized Platform Paper in
which you discuss your ideal learning community and your role as
teacher/leader of that learning community. Select a context for your
paper (i.e.~facilitating in a FAR Centre in a specific country, teaching
adult learners, facilitating employee development workshops, etc.). Your
paper should be written and referenced in APA format and include
references to a minimum of 10 scholarly sources (this can include
literature you read in this course). You will write a draft of the
Platform Paper in Unit 8 and post for Peer Review. In Unit 9, you will
provide feedback to another learner on their paper. You will make
revisions based on the Peer Review and, in Unit 10, you will submit the
final Platform Paper. Peer reviewers will be assigned in advance.
