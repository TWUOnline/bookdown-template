## Course Description

LDRS 697 is a two semester hour course that together with LDRS 698 comprises the four semester hour Leadership integration project capstone. The process of designing and completing LDRS 697/698 is the practical exercise of higher order learning processes. LDRS 697 and 698 are focused on integrating the learning from various program courses into a comprehensive understanding and personal practice of leadership. The learnings of program courses will be collectively analyzed and reevaluated to determine meta-themes to inform a deeper level of scholarly inquiry in the field of leadership. LDRS 697/698 represents the capstone demonstration of a learner’s ability to integrate practical program curriculum content and to demonstrate achievement in the programs defined leadership competencies. The course requires competent use of evidence-based scholarly knowledge, ability to analyze an issue, discipline in the problem-solving process, and scholarly documentation and presentation of information.

## Writing Standards{-}

For this course, you are expected to follow the writing standards according to APA 7. Please consult the [OWL Purdue website](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html){target="_blank"} for guidance and seek assistance from the TWU Writing Center and writing coaches as needed. Assignments have rubrics that attribute some marks to APA formatting and cannot be graded as fully meeting expectations if there are APA errors. That said, your conceptual understanding remains of primary importance. It is your responsibility to ensure polished work to the highest standard of which you are capable. This demands meticulous attention to detail, which will become more 'natural' with practice. Please seek any necessary clarification from your instructor.
